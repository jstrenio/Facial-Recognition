Dependencies:
    This program requires:
        imutils 0.5.3
        Keras 2.4.3
        Tensorflow 2.3.0
        Numpy 1.18.5
        OpenCV 4.4.0.42

Instructions:
    Take exactly 200 images of the target's face and upload them to the raw_images folder. The photos should be of different facial expressions,
    different lighting, and different (slight) angles from the front of the face. run build_dataset_train_model.py. After completion run
    facial_rec.py
